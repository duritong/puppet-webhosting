# This is the configuration file to define which pods or containers
# shall be restarted.
#
# The script will first iterate through all pods, then through containers
# and restart them one by one. This will be done by stopping them. Systemd
# will then ensure they are getting started again.
# Usually on starting, also all images are checked for updates.
#
# Do not try to restart individual containers of a pod, they won't get
# restarted. You will likely have only one pod, named like your hosting
# and thus is the only thing to restart.
#
# --- start example ---
# pods:
#   - myhost.net
# containers: []
# --- end example ---
#
