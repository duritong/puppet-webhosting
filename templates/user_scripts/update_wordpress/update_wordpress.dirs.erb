# The update_wordpress script easily updates
# a wordpress installation for you.
# It will first backup your installation, then
# update the core, all plugins, themes and so on.
#
# This configuration file allows you to configure
# the location of your wordpress installations.
# NOTE: this must be a relative path to your www/
#       directory!
# In most of the times you don't need to adjust
# the only allowed option `wp_directories`.
#
# wp_directories must be an array and it can point
# to multiple wordpress installations within your
# webhosting.
